		<td colspan=4><p>My name is Liam Flubacher and I am a finance major at The University of Maine in Orono. I was born in Somerville, New Jersey, but moved to Maine a few months after I was born. As far as I can remember, I have always lived in a small fishing village called Winter Harbor, Maine. My younger sisters are Tara, 16, and Riley, 14. They both attend Sumner Memorial High School in Sullivan, Maine. In Spring of 2017, I graduated as valedictorian of Sumner with honors. During my high school career, I earned 28 college credits through AP classes and college courses offered to me by The University of Maine at Machias. I now attend The University of Maine in Orono and am pursuing a degree in finance and hope to graduate a year early thanks to the college credits I acquired in high school. A few of my interests include hunting and fishing. During the summer I spend much of my time working and hanging out with my friends.
