		My first school was called Peninsula School and was originally located in Winter Harbor, Maine. However, when I entered 5th grade the school was moved to the town of Prospect Harbor in a brand new building. This is where I would attend school until I entered high school. I went to high school at Sumner Memorial High School in Sullivan, Maine. It was a small school with a population of about 240 students. I graduated in the Spring of 2017 and moved onto my current school. I now attend the University of Maine in Orono. I expect to graduate in 2021 with a bachelor's degree in finance.
